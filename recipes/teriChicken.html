    <p>*Note: you may or may not already have some of these in your pantry or refrigerator</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>On a cutting board, trim fatty bits off of your chicken breasts</li>
        <li>With the knife in your right hand, place your left palm flat on the chicken breast</li>
        <li>Slice on the smooth, rounded side in the middle, laterally, almost all the way through the breast</li>
        <li>Fold open the chicken breast and further slice it until it opens flat
            <ul>
                <li>This is known as "butterflying" a chicken breast. It will help for quicker, more even cooking.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Place the butterflyed chicken into the plastic storage bag</li>
        <li>Pour Soy-Vey Island Teriyaki marinade and sauce or teriyaki marinade of your choice generously over the chicken in the storage bag</li>
        <li>Let marinade at least 30 minutes and/or up to 24 hours</li>
        <li>Pre-heat grill to 450</li>
        <li>While the grill is pre-heating, line a baking pan with tin foil. This will help with clean up later!</li>
        <li>Gather the foil lined baking pan, grill tongs, probe thermometer, and non-stick spray </li>
        <li>Spry the grill with non-stick spray</li>
        <li>Gather the plastic storage bag with the marinaded chicken</li>
        <li>Place chicken on the grill</li>
        <li>Grill chicken 10 to 15 minutes flipping every 5 to 6 minutes until an internal temperature reads 160 degrees. Don't worry, the chicken will continue to cook even after its taken off the grill!</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is internally 160 degrees, remove from heat</li>
        <li>Place another sheet of tinfoil over the heated chicken to let it rest and continue to cook and stay warm</li>
        <li>After resting 5 minutes, slice into strips and serve!</li>
    </ol>
