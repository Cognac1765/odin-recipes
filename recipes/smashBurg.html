    <ul>
        <li>Parchment paper</li>
        <li>Frying pan</li>
        <li>Spatula</li>
        <li>Chef's knife (for chopping vegetables)</li>
        <li>Cutting board</li>
        <li>Ice-cream scoop (not require but nice to make similar sized patties)</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ground beef</li>
        <li>Hamburger buns</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Papper</li>
        <li>Mayonase</li>
    </ul>
    <p>*Note: you may or may not already have some of these in your pantry or refrigerator</p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use the ice-cream scoop to portion ground beef into golf ball sized balls. Rolling the meat into balls in the plam of your hands works well too</li>
        <li>Between two pieces of parchment paper, smash the balls of meat as thin as possible into patties.
        <ul>
            <li>There is also the option of smashing the burgers directly on the pan. By pre-smashing the patties between parchment paper, you can prep multiple burgers before beginning to cook.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li>Carefully slice the onion and tomatoes into full, thin slices</li>
        <li>Chop the lettuce into strips by peeling a few leaves off and rolling them into a tube like fashion and then dicing.</li>
        <li>Set veggies aside until constructing the burger</li>
        <li>Pre-heat the pan on medium</li>
        <li>Melt a tbsp of butter and place the buns flat side down into the pan. This will get them nice and toasty!</li>
        <li>Once your buns are toasted, set them aside and put a healty smear of mayo on the bottom bun followed by lettuce then desired toppings. </li>
        <li>Melt a tbsp of butter and place a patty into the pan</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper exposed patty to taste</li>
        <li>Flip after patty is seared (~2 minutes give or take. They are thin and cook fast!)</li>
        <li>Let patty cook for ~2 minutes or until seared a golden brown</li>
        <li>Remove patty from pan and place directly on awaiting bun</li>
        <li>Top cooked patty with cheese</li>
        <li>Place a 2nd patty into the pan</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper exposed patty to taste</li>
        <li>Flip after patty is seared (~2 minutes give or take. They are thin and cook fast!)</li>
        <li>Top patty with cheese as it finishes cooking in pan</li>
        <li>Place the 2nd patty on top of previously cooked patty</li>
        <li>Top with top bun and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At this point feel free to spice it up and customize it to your liking. Add mustard and ketchup, bacon, anything you like! I hope you enjoy this recipe!</p>
